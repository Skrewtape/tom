  <h1>Apologies</h1>
  We have discovered a bug with the player entries page - specifically, it is not displaying rankings correctly.  We are working hard on fixing problem.<br><br>
  In the meantime, the division entries page is still available and is reflecting correct scores and rankings.  The machines pages is also reflecting correct scores and rankings.
