remove indiv player link in admin mode/desk mode(?)
Bugs
---
* handle no player entered for machine select/ticket buy
* on machine select, checks for "on this machine" come before "no more entrys" check
* bad score just returns you to machine screen
* on division select page, need feedback for which user is selected
** on all multi-page paths, need better feedback of where you are in the process/what has been selected
* division select in main needs to have blacked out more obvious
* when getting the "player is already playing a machine" error, report the machine

Features
---

* Need reasonable "back" buttons
** on score entry

* scorekeeper is incompetent - on the scorekeeper page, need a "the system says the player is paying x, but they are standing right in front of me" button
** need to associate scorekeeper with score

* undo score option on score confirmation page
** add undo for other post/put operations?
* add refresh button on machine list?
* admin console needs a "delete entry" button
* format score in score keeping with commas
* cancel on loading screen after x amount of time and look at better timeouts for ajax
* need to handle "entered wrong player" at the admin level (i.e. how do you handle it if a score was entered under the wrong player num?)
** record and display timestamps in admin level
* options for ordering machines for scorekeepers
* add user
* add new scores to entry in admin mode
* need path so that after adding a player, they can buy a ticket and/or set player division
