remove indiv player link in admin mode/desk mode(?)
Bugs
---
* change score in DB to be a bigger int
* handle no player entered for machine select
* display timestamps in admin level
* on machine select, checks for "on this machine" come before "no more entrys" check
* bad score just returns you to machine screen
* on division select page, need feedback for which user is selected
* division select in main needs to have blacked out more obvious
* when getting the "player is already playing a machine" error, report the machine

Features
---
* error handlers on all axax requests
** need general 500 handler
** loading screen problems ( loading screen comes up and goes off to lala land )
* Number pad for score entry
* Need reasonable "back" buttons
** on score entry
** on division change
** on ticket number selection screen
* scorekeeper is incompetent - on the scorekeeper page, need a "the system says the player is paying x, but they are standing right in front of me" button
* undo score option on score confirmation page
* add refresh button on machine list?
* admin console needs a "delete entry" button
* format score in score keeping with commas
* cancel on loading screen after x amount of time and look at better timeouts for ajax
* need to handle "entered wrong player" at the admin level (i.e. how do you handle it if a score was entered under the wrong player num?)
* options for ordering machines for scorekeepers
* add user
* add new scores to entry in admin mode
* need path so that after adding a player, they can buy a ticket and/or set player division
* need a path to buy multiple tickets in different divisions at once/quickly and show a "reciepet/summary" for people entering info into square
