* need error handlers on everything?  or remove them now that I have general handlers?
* need reusable code for getting/putting/posting
* clean up and split routes.js into indiv files
* refactor ui-router routes

* on division select page, need feedback for which user is selected
* division select in main needs to have blacked out more obvious
* better formatting ( don't show when not appropriate ) on player page
* oops - can't enter score on desktop

herb style vs papa style
* entry is limited to x number of scores
* rank of scores is based on going through all machine scores
* rank of entry is based on sum of all machines scores for that entry
* in order to do herb style, player gets one entry and infinite machine scores on the entry
* rank of scores is based on going through all machine scores
* rank of entry is based on top score from X machines

* current algoritm
foreach division {
 foreach machine in division {
  list scores in order;
  assign rank to machine;
  calculate points for machine score and add to entry score;
 }
 foreach entry in division {
  list entrys in order of score;
  set rank of entry;  
 }
}

*new algo
NOTE : in memory entry tracking needs to keep track of highest score per machine
foreach division {
 foreach machine in division {
  list scores in order;
  assign rank to machine;
  #calculate points for machine score and add to entry score;
  check if entry has a higher score for this machine - if no, add to entry score 
 }
 foreach entry in division {
  list entrys in order of score;
  set rank of entry;  
 }
}
