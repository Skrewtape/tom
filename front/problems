remove indiv player link in admin mode/desk mode(?)
Bugs
---
* on machine select, checks for "on this machine" come before "no more entrys" check
* on division select page, need feedback for which user is selected
* division select in main needs to have blacked out more obvious
* better formatting ( don't show when not appropriate ) on player page
* oops - can't enter score on desktop
Features
---
* results display
* need a player lookup page
** void ( for scorekeeper and desk person)
** change linked divison ( for desk )
** edit entries ( for elizabeth )
** show player info - done
* recording score - change wording of buttons/flow to "review score/submit score"
* need path so that after adding a player, they can buy a ticket and/or set player division
* need "debug button" in loading screen, plus need to add "breadcrumbs" to statusmodal which can be dumped on debug button
* need a path to buy multiple tickets in different divisions at once/quickly and show a "reciepet/summary" for people entering info into square
* undo
** undo info will be kept at angular level? flask level?  if at flask level, you can have an "undo" action?  yeah - this needs to be at flask level
** added to machine
** void ticket ( for scorekeeper - no for now)
** purchasing ticket ( no for now )
** linking division - NO, too complicated
* options for ordering machines for scorekeepers
* need to handle "entered wrong player" at the admin level (i.e. how do you handle it if a score was entered under the wrong player num?)
** record and display timestamps in admin level
* add new scores to entry in admin mode
* player is asshole
** related "machine is out of service"
* scorekeeper is incompetent - on the scorekeeper page, need a "the system says the player is paying x, but they are standing right in front of me" button
** need to associate scorekeeper with score
** need to notify scorekeeper when they fucked up?  needs a "check every x seconds for message for this scorekeeper" function
* add refresh button on machine list?
* admin console needs a "delete entry" button
* cancel on loading screen after x amount of time and look at better timeouts for ajax (still needed?)
* add user
* clean up all the crap I threw in for format score in score keeping with commas
* clean up UI for player select (i.e. add input group for input, etc )

Workpad
---
* voiding from machinelist
** playerslect with "get active entry" button
** display entry with "void ticket" button
