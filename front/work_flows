#PPO features
* need to handle "return to top of finals - need to maintain tab"
* need to maintain finals order on match list page
* finals need display(for players) vs editing(scorekeepers) view - by wed
* need team to work in finals - by fri


* need to "auto-complete" entries based on tournament type - by tue
** need to add field to tournament (i.e. ppo or papa style qualifying)
* add ability to set number of qualifying spots per division (or tournament?)  
* need indicator of tiebreakers needed on player select page for finals
* replace makearray with new range filter
* change edit scores in admin to use commas

# current work
# check for dups

#Bugs
* results index gets sad if there is a division with no machines in it

#"Broken"/Missing existing functionality
* finals need to handle team divisions

#Fix existing Features
* Need ability to mark player as incorrect (i.e. player needs to be removed due to machine breaking?)
** fix frontend
** fix backend
* finish fixing ui tweaks
* Need a "save/confirm/delete" button for X'ing out scores?
* limit number of multidivision tournaments to 1 (in ui)
* make sure "division" isn't in division name, "tournament" not in tournament name
* add entry rank to player results

#Tests (manual)
* run through every path as single player
* as team
* as herb (single division)
* as herb (multiple division)
* reload on each page (that isn't a process page)

#New Features
* add new service for setting/getting the backend ip
** all refrences to APIHOST should be replaced by this call
* need to be able to have "player 100" every year at papa
** Guyh - this will require a complete re-enginering of anything that uses the player id
** Current best bet - player id is a pk with "meta-tournament" (i.e. papa16 vs papa15)
** Everything that uses a playerid needs to be changed to use this
** Admin functionality will either need to have a metatournament chosen, or admin func will need to offer options after player choice
* add "start/end" date for tournaments to add tournaments page
* figure out where we need to use the following : all_divisions, all_tournaments, all_active_divisions, all_divisions_for_given_date_range VS active_X
* need a mobile only purchase tickets screen
* need to add unique pin per player
* need to display player unique pin during player creation?  or maybe it has to be emailed?  
* need a "add email address" page for players
* Remove a machine and re-add (note : is this a valid scenario? do we actually want a "disable machine while being repaired" option?)
* Remove divisions/disable from tournament(?) - not currently an option
* Remove team/disable - not available
* Remove metadivisions/disable - not available
* need summary results page ( i.e. no network connection, everyone crowded around a monitor )
* need ability to change finals score/follow dougs suggestions for finals score entry

#Refactor
* refactor routes to v1
* Suck out any hardcoded css into scss files
* Make pages phone-mobile friendly
** shorten longer input field names
* need to cleanup record score ui ( need to figure out how to fit all those buttons AND see your previous scores )
